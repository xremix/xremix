### Hi there 👋

I'm Toni, a Senior Software Developer from Munich, working mostly on business mobile apps and web applications and marketing communication websites.

### My Passion 👨‍💻

For me, Software Engineering is about complex problem solving, understanding people, creating aesthetic design, being a communicator between domain areas, achieving goals, performing creativity, thinking in strategies... but it's also about coding and a passion to tech.
